## Problem Statement

Lannisters and White walkers are battling against each other.
Daenerys plans on taking the opportunity and attack unexpectedly on weakest points during the battle with her dragons. 

Sheâ€™s sent a message by her followers of the timing when it would be feasible. 

See if you can break it to catch up to her plans.

### Message:
`aDRACARYScDRACARYSuDRACARYStDRACARYSaDRACARYSkDRACARYSdDRACARYSsDRACARYStDRACARYS@DRACARYSk`

## Hint
* Itâ€™s an _encrypted_ message, as strong as the de*fence* of the *number* of her dragons.

## Solution

- If looked carefully, the message has DRACARYS throughout the string. 
- It hints it being a repitive text and either a simple python code can be written or can be done manually to remove DRACARYS and rejoining to form a new string which is the encrypted message we need.
- Now, the italic texts hint at _encrypted_ and de**fence** and something about the **number** of her dragons. On search, one can find about RAIL FENCE ENCRYPTION ALGORITHM where the count of rails is required to decode it. Daenerys has **3** dragons which will serve as the rails' count for us.
- We have enough RAIL FENCE ENCRYPTION websites and putting it all together, we get- `attack@dusk`
