Answer: `MAZE{targaryen}` <br>

### Problem Statement

Jon received a note from the Lannisters containing an encrypted message of `pwmfzqqwf`. Previously it had been agreed between them that the original message would have been divided into 3 equal parts and encrypted using ceasar cipher with different keys. There only clue given to him was to use his "teapot".

### Hint

Do you know the "status" of teapot?

### Solution
I'm a teapot is HTTP Status Code 418. Using 4,1,8 as the 3 keys in ceaser cipher pwm becomes tar, fzq becomes gar and qwf becomes yen. Combining which it is targaryen.
