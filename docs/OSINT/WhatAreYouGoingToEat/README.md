## Problem Statement

The organisers assigned "hotpii3" to get food for the contestants. You are supposed to tell him what to get in the language of computers.


## Hint

Computer understands the language of 1's and 0's right?

## Solution

On finding the github account with username "h0tpii3", there is a repo with the same name as name of the question. In the readme there is a link to an audio file. The size of this audio file seems to be suspiciously large. There this gives a hint to search for hidden files in it. On retrieving the hidden files using deepsound, gives qr code images. Upon scanning those, You will find one of the image giving proper solution as "pi33a 1t i5". As mentioned in the question his intelligence is same as the computers intelligence implying to give the answer in binary.
